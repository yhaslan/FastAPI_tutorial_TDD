# **Docker Commands**

This guide outlines common Docker commands for managing containers and networks.

- **Start docker-compose, build, and bring up container in the background:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose -p fastapi-development up -d
    ```

- **Docker Compose Flags:**
    - `-p`: Specify a project name. Useful for creating separate projects with their own isolated networks.
    - `-f FILE`: Specify an alternate docker-compose file (default: docker-compose.yml).
    - `-d`: Detached mode. Run containers in the background.
    - `-e VAR=VAL`: Set environment variables. Can be used multiple times to set multiple variables.
    - `-v`: Show version information and exit.
    - `-h`: Show help information and exit.

    This command starts the Docker containers defined in the docker-compose.yml file. It builds the images if necessary and brings up the containers in the background (`-d` flag).

- **View available networks:**
    ```bash
    docker network ls
    ```

    This command lists all available Docker networks. Docker networks enable communication between containers running on the same host or across different hosts.

- **Start docker-compose, build and bring up container in background:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose -p fastapi-development up -d
    ```

    This command starts the Docker containers defined in the docker-compose.yml file. It builds the images if necessary and brings up the containers in the background (`-d` flag).

- **View available networks:**
    ```bash
    docker network ls
    ```

    This command lists all available Docker networks. Docker networks enable communication between containers running on the same host or across different hosts.

- **List running containers:**
    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```

    This command lists all running Docker containers along with their IDs, names, and status.

- **List all containers (including stopped ones):**
    ```bash
    docker ps -a
    ```

    This command lists all Docker containers, including those that are stopped or exited.

- **Stop a running container:**
    ```bash
    docker stop container-name
    ```

    This command stops the specified Docker container. Replace `container-name` with the name or ID of the container.

- **Remove a container:**
    ```bash
    docker rm container-name
    ```

    This command removes the specified Docker container. Use the `-f` flag to force removal if the container is running.

- **View container logs:**
    ```bash
    docker logs container-name
    ```

    This command displays the logs generated by the specified Docker container. Replace `container-name` with the name or ID of the container.

- **Execute a command inside a container:**
    ```bash
    docker exec -it container-name command
    ```

    This command allows you to execute a command inside a running Docker container. Use the `-it` flags for interactive mode and replace `command` with the desired command to execute.

- **Pull an image from Docker Hub:**
    ```bash
    docker pull image-name
    ```

    This command pulls the specified Docker image from Docker Hub or any other Docker registry.

- **Build a Docker image from a Dockerfile:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t image-name path/to/dockerfile
    ```

    This command builds a Docker image using the Dockerfile located at the specified path and tags it with the specified image name (`-t` flag).
